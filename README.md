hi, i'm azure. i mostly do stuff with docker, java, golang and typescript, and i'm also trying to learn other languages like C.

### some of my projects
- [azuvotifier](https://github.com/azurejelly/azuvotifier), a modern NuVotifier fork with Sponge 11+ support, a standalone implementation and Redis forwarding.
- [jelly-chats](https://github.com/azurejelly/jelly-chats), a Velocity plugin that adds highly customizable Redis-based private chats.
- [nayuki](https://github.com/azurejelly/nayuki), a somewhat simple Discord suggestion management bot written in Go.
- [better-player-list](https://github.com/azurejelly/better-player-list), a Fabric mod which attempts to improve the default Minecraft player list.
- [konata-mod](https://github.com/azurejelly/konata-mod), a (stupid) Fabric mod that adds Konata Izumi images or jumpscares to your Minecraft client.

### some (public) projects i've contributed to
- [VERT](https://github.com/VERT-sh/VERT), a free, open source and mostly local file conversion utility.
- [vertd](https://github.com/VERT-sh/vertd), what VERT uses for video conversion.
- [Perspective Enhancements](https://github.com/girlbossdev/PerspectiveEnhancements), a Minecraft mod that allows you to customize the perspective key behavior
